## Reminder
- Inainte sa incep as vrea sa va multumesc pentru buna colaborare si intelegere. Have fun!

## Vizion

- The platform needs more **dynamic elements**, easier **accessibility** of functionality for users and more **security**.

## Functionality

### Login_page 

- Story: I logged in, I applied to a course and I left the platform without giving a request for logout, if in the next two hours I will go back to the platorfma, I want her to know about me without having to log in.

- My idea: When I access the platform I want a pop up that asks me if I want to stay with the current user or log in with another user.

### Register_page

- When I sign up I want a pop up as a reminder that I have to activate my account.

- This pop has two buttons, "ok" leading to the login page and the "Go to email" button which opens a new window to "https//mail.google.com" to activate the account but at the same time redirects me to login on current page.

### User_page

- When I click on the "Wish" button I want the request to be sent, the course disappears from the screen if the request was successfully submitted and on the right side of the window I want a green or red note. green with the text "Your request has been sent!" for successful application and red with the text "Failed request" for a failed application, the note is deleted after 2-3 seconds.

### Tm_page

- When I send the request for enrollment of the team I want it to happen exactly as the rule of "Wish".

- When someone sends me a request I want to receive an email telling me that I have received an enrollment request from a user.

### Pm_page

- When I click on a user I want a pop up that shows me user data (without password xD).

- Above the enrollment list I want a list of basic filters: filtering after the course, receiving the request, name etc..

- When a TM sends a request for registration I want to be notified by email.

### Admin_page

- The admin page must have a way to create users and set the user type, TM, PM or USER.
